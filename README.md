# QGAN for generating continuous distribution
This implementation is based on this article:
[Jonathan Romero and Alan Aspuru-Guzik. Variational quantum generators: Generative adversarial quantum machine learning for continuous distributions, 2019.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00848)

The most important step is to encode classical information as the parameters of a variational quantum circuit, thus encoding it into a quantum state.
